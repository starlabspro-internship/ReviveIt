# Revivelt

## Project Overview
Our project aims to create a user-friendly platform that facilitates interactions between clients, technicians, and companies. The platform will provide solutions for anything that needs to be fixed. Revivelt is a community-driven web platform that connects users with global/local professional technicians and companies across different service categories.

## User Types
1. **Clients**: Can browse and hire technicians/companies, communicate via messages, and manage their profiles.
2. **Technicians**: Can offer services, respond to client posts, and manage their profiles and subscriptions.
3. **Companies**: Can offer services and handle company settings.

## Key Features
- **Sign-Up Process**: Customized forms for clients, technicians, and companies.
- **Profile Management**: Easy-to-use interfaces for updating personal or company information.
- **Messaging System**: Secure and efficient communication.
- **Job Posts**: Clients can submit detailed service requests, and technicians can respond with feedback.
- **Subscription Plans**: Optional plans for enhanced services and features.

## Simplified Flow
1. **User Registration**: Sign up as a client, technician, or company.
2. **Profile Setup**: Customize the profile with relevant information.
3. **Service Interaction**: Clients search for technicians or companies based on the service they need. Technicians or companies that offer the selected service will appear in the search results. Clients can choose to discuss and hire them. Additionally, clients can submit posts about detailed service requests. Technicians can respond with reactions or feedback, helping clients find the right solution for their needs.
